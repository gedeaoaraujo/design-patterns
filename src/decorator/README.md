<h1>Decorator Pattern</h1>

<p>This pattern is used for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        To add responsibilities to individual objects dynamically and transparently, that is, without affecting other objects.
    </li>
    <li>
        For responsibilities that can be withdrawn.
    </li>
    <li>
        When extension by sub-classing is impractical. Sometimes a large number of independent extensions are possible and would
        produce an explosion of subclasses to support every combination. Or a class definition may be hidden or otherwise unavailable
        for sub-classing.
    </li>
</ul>
