<h1>Adapter Pattern</h1>

<p>This pattern is used for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To transform a existing class in the new form needed.</li>
    <li>To use a class unrelated or unforeseen for cooperate with another, inclusive with not equivalent interface.</li>
    <li>When is impractical to creat an interface for every subclasses. To adapt the interface of an object super class.</li>
</ul>
