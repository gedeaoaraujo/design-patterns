<h1>Facade Pattern</h1>

<p>This pattern is used for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>To create a simple interface for a subsystem.</li>
    <li>There are many dependencies between clients and the implementation classes of an abstraction. Introduce a facade to decouple
        the subsystem from clients and other subsystems, thereby promoting subsystem independence and portability.
    </li>
    <li>To create top layers in complex subsystems.</li>
    <li>To simplify the communication between subsystems through their facades.</li>
</ul>
