<h1>Composite Pattern</h1>

<p>This pattern is used for:</p>

<ul>
    <li>When you want to represent part-whole hierarchies of objects.
    </li>
    <li> When you want clients to be able to ignore the difference between compositions of objects and individual objects. Clients will
         treat all objects in the composite structure uniformly.
    </li>
</ul>
